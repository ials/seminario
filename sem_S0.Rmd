## Course Objectives

This course gives you an opportunity to produce the first version of your thesis in the field of geoinformatics based on the research project you are carrying out at UNAL in the last years. 

This is a process-oriented writing course that integrates reading, research, writing, and oral presentations. 

As an alternative to writing your thesis, you may focus on writing a research article. However, **I do not encourage to attempt both challenges because the chances of you failing are high**.  

In any case, you must compile a portfolio with all the drafts, notes about the texts read, my feedback, your supervisor feedfack,  research proposal, literature review, class activities, and any written work done for your project.

## Course Objectives (cont...)

You will also present the results of each stage of your work to me and the other students in the course. Other members of the University community may be invited to the presentations. 

Your writing output is expected to conform to appropriate standards of scholarship. 

Additionally, you will engage in a series of class activities aimed at helping you develop your  reading, research, writing, and presentation skills.

### What type of information should you include in your introduction?

In the introduction you are trying to do three main things:

**Move 1** establish your territory (say what the topic is about)

**Move 2** establish a niche  (say why there needs to be further research on your topic)

**Move 3** introduce your research (formulate the problem; state research questions; make hyphotheses)
